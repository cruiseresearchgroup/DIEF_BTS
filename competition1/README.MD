# Brick by Brick: Automating Building Data Classification Challenge

A global challenge to automate building data classification, unlocking more intelligent, energy-efficient buildings for a sustainable future.

Buildings are one of the biggest energy consumers in the modern world, making energy efficiency essential. However, managing building systems data across different buildings is time-intensive and costly due to inconsistent data formats. This challenge invites you to transform building management by creating a solution that classifies building data automatically, promoting standardised, energy-efficient management for a more sustainable world.

# Starter Kit

To get started, follow these seven easy steps:

1. Join the challenge from the official AICrowd website and accept the terms: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/brick-by-brick-2024
2. Download the dataset: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/brick-by-brick-2024/dataset_files
3. Download [`random_submission_py.py`](/competition1/random_submission.py)
4. Create a directory called `data/` in the same location as the `random_submission.py` file 
5. Move the downloaded dataset files into the `data/` directory. 
6. Run [`random_submission.py`](/competition1/random_submission.py) locally, and it will generate a sample submission file `data/sample_submission_v0.1.0.csv.gz`. Might take few minutes.
7. Upload a sample submission file `data/sample_submission_v0.1.0.csv.gz`

You can also use other codes in this library. Note that there are slight changes in the setup between the benchamrk for the paper and the competiton.
