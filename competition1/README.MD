# Brick by Brick: Automating Building Data Classification Challenge

A global challenge to automate building data classification, unlocking more intelligent, energy-efficient buildings for a sustainable future.

Buildings are one of the biggest energy consumers in the modern world, making energy efficiency essential. However, managing building systems data across different buildings is time-intensive and costly due to inconsistent data formats. This challenge invites you to transform building management by creating a solution that classifies building data automatically, promoting standardised, energy-efficient management for a more sustainable world.

# Starter Kit

To get started, follow these seven easy steps:

1. Join the challenge from the official AICrowd website and accept the terms: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/brick-by-brick-2024
2. Download the dataset: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/brick-by-brick-2024/dataset_files
3. Download [`random_submission.py`](/competition1/random_submission.py)
4. Create a directory called `data/` in the same location as the `random_submission.py` file 
5. Move the downloaded dataset files into the `data/` directory. 
6. Run [`random_submission.py`](/competition1/random_submission.py) locally, and it will generate a sample submission file `data/sample_submission_v0.1.0.csv.gz`. Might take few minutes.
7. Upload a sample submission file `data/sample_submission_v0.1.0.csv.gz`

You can also use other codes in this library. Note that there are slight changes in the setup between the benchamrk for the paper and the competiton.

The evaluation function is available here: https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/DIEF_BTS/blob/9ac4f4ea077ef0fed129a6761d77e1563056f6c2/20240530_class_code/thuml_tslib_dief/diefComp1Utils.py#L338
