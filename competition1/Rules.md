Personal data you submit in relation to this Challenge will be used by Sponsor and Sponsor Admins in accordance to Section 14 of these Rules.


## 8. HOW WILL WINNERS BE SELECTED AND NOTIFIED?

Teams must upload their Entry to the Sponsor Admin’s platform, which will be run and compared against the test set. Submissions will be evaluated first on a smaller subset of data, and non-meaningful submissions will be discarded without further evaluation and not be posted on the leaderboard. Sponsor maintains right to change the definition of non-meaningful during the Challenge Period based on statistics derived from the highest scoring, previously-submitted entries.

Potential winners will be contacted via the email associated with AIcrowd.com account through which the Entry was submitted. If a potential winner cannot be contacted, does not respond as directed, refuses the prize, or is found to be ineligible for any reason, such prize may be forfeited and awarded to an alternate winner. Only one alternate winner will be selected per each prize package, after which prizes will remain unawarded.

To the extent that there is any dispute as to the identity of the potential winner, the official account holder of the email address associated with the AIcrowd account through which the Entry was first submitted will be deemed the official potential winner by Sponsor.

## 9. Submissions

Submissions are managed through the AIcrowd platform, allowing participants to upload ten daily submissions in CSV format. Predictions must follow the specified format for validation, and leaderboard scores will reflect test set performance for real-time rankings.

## 10. Solution Validation and Reporting


Participants can upload up to ten submissions per day in CSV format. Each submission must adhere strictly to the prescribed format to ensure accurate leaderboard evaluations, reflecting the test set's real-time performance.

The competition is structured into two rounds, allowing participants to refine their entries if necessary. To maintain fairness and the integrity of the results, standard AIcrowd competition rules will apply:

1. **Code and Model Validation**: The top submissions that qualify for final consideration will undergo rigorous scrutiny to validate the code and models, ensuring that only the provided dataset has been used.
2. **Dataset Limitations**: Participants must exclusively train their models using the dataset provided by the organisers. The use of external datasets is strictly prohibited.
3. **Solution Documentation**: Winners must document their methodology thoroughly. This includes a mandatory detailed solution report that should be submitted for publication on arXiv, fostering transparency and contributing to the community's collective knowledge.

In addition, participants must meet a minimum performance threshold to qualify for prize consideration, ensuring that only the most effective solutions are rewarded.

## 11. YOUR ODDS OF WINNING

ODDS OF WINNING A PRIZE ARE SUBJECT TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE ENTRIES RECEIVED AND HOW YOUR ENTRY SCORES IN ACCORDANCE TO THE JUDGING CRITERIA.

## 12. PRIZES

We will award a total prize pool of 20,000 AUD. The details of prize money per task can be found in the challenge page. Challenge prizes include the in-person presentation grant, which will be paid to winning teams presenting their solutions in person at the The Web Conference 2025. This remuneration is to be paid after the presentation.

To receive a prize, the Team must make the submission via the AIcrowd portal under the Apache 2.0 license, and submit its training code and a detailed document describing its training process. The description must be written in English, with mathematical formulae as necessary. The description must be written at a level sufficient for a practitioner in computer science to reproduce the results obtained by the Team. It must describe substantially the training and tuning process to reproduce results independently. Failure to submit both the code and description within one week of notification will disqualify that entry and additional qualifying entries will be considered for prizes. Sponsor reserves right not to award prizes to any Team whose results cannot be reproduced. Winners may be required to submit a high-level explanation of their approach. This could include a concise presentation, such as a 10-minute video overview detailing their methodology and key insights. All participants are expected to submit a detailed report of their solution on arXiv, providing transparency and contributing to the broader research community.


## 13. WHEN WILL PRIZES BE AWARDED?

The prizes will be awarded within a commercially reasonable time frame. All members of a Team may be required to complete and sign additional documentation, such as non-disclosure agreements, representations and warranties, liability and publicity releases (unless prohibited by applicable law), and tax documents, or other similar documentation in order for the potentially winning team to claim the prize. Sponsor will divide all awards that are payable to Entrant Teams evenly among all Entrant Team members and distribute accordingly. Sponsor will in no way be involved in any dispute with respect to receipt of a prize by any other members of a Team. Prize distribution may take upto 6 months after the winners are notified.

Only prizes claimed in accordance to these Rules will be awarded.
